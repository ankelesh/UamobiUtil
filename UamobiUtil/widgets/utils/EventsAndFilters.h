/*
	This file contains everything related to handling events. Mostly KeyEvents
		NoKeyEvents:
			Despite it's name it does not eat key releases: it just intercepts them and
			emits corresponding signals. Main goal of this class is to keep outer reactions
			of widget while shutting down it's own. Example of usage: class ScaningWidget.
			There is barcodelist - a ListWidget, which must not react to number key presses,
			but all numbers must be counted. So this filter intercepts them and puts into signals.

		CaptureBackFilter:
			This filter is lighter version of NoKeyEvents. Only reacts to back key.

		GeneralPurposeFilter:
			This filter is multi-option filter which can be adjusted for filtering a specified group of events.
			it uses pointers for enhancing filtering, so it is faster than simple if ladder.
